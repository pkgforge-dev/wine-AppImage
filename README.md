AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun) and its wrapper [quick-sharun](https://github.com/pkgforge-dev/Anylinux-AppImages/blob/main/useful-tools/quick-sharun.sh), which makes it easy and reliable to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks. 

**This AppImage bundles everything and it should work on any Linux distro, including old and musl-based ones.**

This AppImage doesn't require FUSE to run at all, thanks to the [uruntime](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/uruntime).

This AppImage is also supplied with the seamless self-updater by default, so any updates to this application won't be missed.  
Self-updater doesn't run if AppImage managers like [am](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) or [soar](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) exist, which manage AppImage integration and updates.  
There is also a prompt and config for opting-out of self-updates if desired.
